# FoodExpress - Food Delivery Application

## Overview

FoodExpress is a full-stack food delivery web application that allows users to browse food items across multiple categories (Rotis, Lunch & Dinner, Hotel Specials), add items to their cart, and place orders. The application features authentication via Replit's OpenID Connect, real-time cart management, and a responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system based on shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form with Zod for form validation

**Backend:**
- Express.js running on Node.js
- TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack
- Session-based authentication using express-session

**Design System:**
- Custom Tailwind configuration with shadcn/ui (New York style)
- Design inspired by leading food delivery platforms (Uber Eats, DoorDash, Swiggy, Zomato)
- Typography using Inter/DM Sans with consistent spacing units (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)
- Responsive grid layouts: 3-4 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile

### Authentication & Authorization

**Customer Authentication (OpenID Connect via Replit):**
- Passport.js strategy for OIDC authentication
- Session management with configurable session stores (in-memory for development)
- User data synchronized from OIDC claims to local user records
- Protected routes require authentication via `isAuthenticated` middleware
- Automatic token refresh handling

**Admin Authentication (JWT-based):**
- Separate authentication system for admin users using JWT tokens
- Username and password-based login with bcrypt password hashing
- Access tokens (15-minute expiry) and refresh tokens (7-day expiry)
- Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies for security
- Automatic token refresh when access token expires
- Role-based access control with three roles: `super_admin`, `manager`, `viewer`
- Protected admin routes with AdminGuard component

**Session Management:**
- 7-day session TTL (time-to-live)
- HTTP-only cookies for security
- Secure flag enabled in production environments
- Session secret configurable via environment variables

### Data Layer Architecture

**Schema Design:**
The application uses a shared schema (`shared/schema.ts`) with Drizzle ORM defining six main entities:

1. **Users** - Stores customer profile information from OIDC provider
2. **Admin Users** - Stores admin accounts with username, email, password hash, and role
3. **Categories** - Product categorization (Rotis, Lunch & Dinner, Hotel Specials)
4. **Products** - Food items with pricing, images, ratings, and dietary flags (vegetarian)
5. **Orders** - Customer orders with delivery details and itemized products
6. **Sessions** - PostgreSQL-based session persistence
7. **Chefs** - Partner chefs and restaurants with ratings and reviews

**Storage Abstraction:**
- `IStorage` interface defines all data operations
- `MemStorage` class provides in-memory implementation with seed data
- Designed for easy migration to PostgreSQL implementation
- All storage methods are async to support future database integration

### API Architecture

**Customer API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Fetch authenticated user profile (protected)
- `GET /api/categories` - List all food categories
- `GET /api/products` - List all products (supports `?categoryId` filter)
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get single product details
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order (protected, validated with Zod)
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Retrieve order details (protected)
- `GET /api/chefs` - List all chefs/restaurants
- `GET /api/chefs/:categoryId` - Get chefs by category
- `POST /api/calculate-delivery` - Calculate delivery fee based on location

**Admin API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/admin/auth/login` - Admin login with username/password
- `POST /api/admin/auth/logout` - Admin logout
- `POST /api/admin/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token using refresh token
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard/metrics` - Dashboard metrics (user count, orders, revenue, etc.)
- `GET /api/admin/orders` - List all orders
- `PATCH /api/admin/orders/:id/status` - Update order status (manager+)
- `GET /api/admin/categories` - List all categories
- `POST /api/admin/categories` - Create category (manager+)
- `PATCH /api/admin/categories/:id` - Update category (manager+)
- `DELETE /api/admin/categories/:id` - Delete category (super_admin)
- `GET /api/admin/products` - List all products
- `POST /api/admin/products` - Create product (manager+)
- `PATCH /api/admin/products/:id` - Update product (manager+)
- `DELETE /api/admin/products/:id` - Delete product (super_admin)
- `GET /api/admin/users` - List all customer users
- `GET /api/admin/chefs` - List all chefs
- `GET /api/admin/admins` - List all admin users (super_admin)
- `POST /api/admin/admins` - Create new admin user (super_admin)

**Request/Response Pattern:**
- JSON payloads for all API communications
- Zod schema validation on order creation
- Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Request logging middleware for debugging API calls

### State Management Strategy

**Server State (TanStack Query):**
- Centralized query client configuration
- Custom `queryFn` with 401 unauthorized handling
- Infinite stale time and disabled refetching for stable data
- Optimistic updates for cart operations

**Client State (React useState):**
- Cart items managed in Home component
- UI state (modals, drawers) managed locally in components
- Search query state for product filtering

**Authentication State:**
- Custom `useAuth` hook wrapping TanStack Query
- Returns user object, loading state, and authentication status
- Separate routing logic for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users

### Component Architecture

**Page Components:**
- `Landing.tsx` - Unauthenticated welcome page with feature highlights
- `Home.tsx` - Main authenticated dashboard with categories, products, and cart
- `NotFound.tsx` - 404 error page

**Feature Components:**
- `Header` - Sticky navigation with search, cart badge, user menu
- `Hero` - Full-width banner with location input and search
- `CategoryCard` - Visual card for browsing food categories
- `ProductCard` - Food item card with add-to-cart controls
- `CartSidebar` - Slide-out cart with quantity controls and checkout
- `CheckoutDialog` - Modal form for order placement
- `MenuDrawer` - Mobile-friendly navigation drawer
- `Footer` - Links and newsletter signup

**UI Components:**
- 40+ shadcn/ui components (buttons, forms, dialogs, etc.)
- Consistent design tokens via CSS variables
- Dark mode support structure in place
- Hover and active state elevation effects

### Build & Development Configuration

**Vite Configuration:**
- Development server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Path aliases: `@/` for client code, `@shared/` for shared schemas, `@assets/` for images
- Conditional Replit-specific plugins (cartographer, dev banner, runtime error overlay)
- Production build outputs to `dist/public`

**TypeScript Configuration:**
- Strict mode enabled for type safety
- ESNext module resolution with bundler strategy
- Incremental compilation with build info caching
- Shared types between client and server via `@shared` alias

**Development vs. Production:**
- Development: Vite dev server proxies API requests to Express
- Production: Express serves pre-built static assets from `dist/public`
- Environment-specific configurations for sessions and cookies
